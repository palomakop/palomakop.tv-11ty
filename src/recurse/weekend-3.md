- Came into the Hub on Sunday evening for a bit of work time, since I was in the city and wanted a quiet environment.
- I did some design tweaks to the Tarot GUI so far and added a dynamic little moon phase emoji icon that indicates the current moon phase.
- React is still confusing to me and I still feel like I'm cargo-culting it with this react-router starter template, but I want to finish a working GUI sooner than later so I don't want to start over from scratch. Anyway, as far as templates go, there is very little example content.
- I wanted to animate page transitions, and tried a few different methods (again, without knowing fully what I was doing) and couldn't get anything to work, but I found {% extLink "this guide for react-transition-group" "https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/with-react-router" %} which seems the most applicable to my setup of anything I've found so far. I'm still not sure how to apply it since my project has `routes.ts` in a separate file from `root.tsx` but perhaps if I save the bookmark, I will be able to make use of it later once I've figured out more.

#### To-do:
- Start actually building the form page to submit a new tarot pull. This will be the main part of my app and I think I've noodled around enough that I should start working on the meat and potatoes (or tofu and potatoes if we are vegetarians). I'll be coming back into the hub tomorrow morning so will resume then!
