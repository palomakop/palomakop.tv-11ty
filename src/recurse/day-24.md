- Yay, I got the tarot spreads to show up on the `/pull/{id}` page! Still some improvements to be made, but it's already working.
- Hooked up the tarot app to the domain [Subtle.cards](https://subtle.cards), it's live on the internet~
- Added the tarot app project to my [technical projects list](https://github.com/palomakop/technical-projects-list), and updated the readmes of both repos with more info and links.
- Joined the Presentations call, I especially enjoyed seeing 
- I feel like I'm almost where I want to be for v1 of this project! Mostly I just want to create some delightful animations to simulate the cards being pulled, and fix a couple of little quirks. I've already signed up to present next week... Which will also be the end of my batch, omg...
