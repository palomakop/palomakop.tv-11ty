- I didn't post any updates on days 19 and 20, oops! I was pretty busy attending the Low Tech Electronics Faire in Philly, where I also taught an HTML workshop. I made [a post](/blog/2025-03-17_low-tech-electronics-faire/) about it on my blog!
- I also didn't post an update for Weekend 4, but that's probably fine because I didn't do much that was programming-related. I mostly decompressed from last week's travels, and did things to prepare for the coming week.
- Today I am back in "The Office" (read: doing work on my computer). I am really excited to keep working on my tarot app front end and hopefully finish it this week, but first, I have some admin work to get out of the way. I'll probably keep working on that for most of today, and then resume project mode later this afternoon or tomorrow morning.
- I also joined Monday Meditation call, where we listened to a guided meditation/contemplation by Ethan Nichtern called *Meditation on Hope and Fear*. It was nice and I really like having this weekly ritual of meeting and meditation together, whether I'm joining in person or from home.
