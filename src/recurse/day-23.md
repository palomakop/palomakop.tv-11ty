- A quick update because I'm heading to yoga class in a moment.
- Made some good progress on the tarot app. I added a little animation for when the cards are being pulled, and passed the data in from the API when the page navigates to the new pull. If you load the card pull page from elsewhere, it gets the data from the API at that point.
- Started the very beginning of building the `/pull/{id}` page. I had to learn a bit about interfaces and start declaring some types. Next steps will be to map through the list of cards and render them each as a Card component.
- Also joined the Critical AI Discussion Group call. I was late because I lost track of time coding, but we had another very interesting discussion.
