- Fixed the `/get-pull/{id}` method to parse the json coming from the database properly and make the response formed the same as the call to `/create-pull`
- Added documentation in the readme and edited routes to be nicer:
  - <s>`/create-pull`</s> is now `/pull/new`
  - <s>`/get-pull/{id}`</s> is now `/pull/{id}`.
- Yay! I have a working POC of my Flask API and can start building the front-end for my tarot app. {% extLink "Github repo" "https://github.com/palomakop/tarot-flask" %}
- I was planning to build the front end with Vue.js, but for the sake of practicality I might use React, since it's more standard and will probably be more useful in job contexts. I think I will start with React + Typescript, then maybe try it with Next. But I still definitely want to learn Vue (and Nuxt) too, they seem more useful and pleasant for future personal projects than React. In both frameworks, I'll be working with Typescript.
- Had a very enlightening chat with Kate about databases and general practices and approaches for using them.
- Joined the Reflect and Unblock meeting led by Emily, and discussed our experiences so far and intentioned for the rest of our batches. I also pulled a tarot card with the new API and got *Ace of Swords*, which I suppose bodes well for clarity and breakthroughs in the remainder of my time.
  - This reminds me that I am almost halfway done with my batch now. Wowow!
- Went to a whirlwind of {% extLink "Presentations" "https://presentations.recurse.com/?date=1741290000000" %}
