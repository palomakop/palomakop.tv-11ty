title: Days 27 & 28

- Oops, it's day 28, but I never published my log from yesterday, so this entry is for both days.
- Yesterday I brought my video synth into the hub for demopalooza. It was a bit heavy to carry on the subway but ended up being well worth the effort, because it was very fun to show it to people.
- I also sat down with the tarot app for a bit yesterday afternoon, working through a list of cosmetic and UI tweaks. There is still a bit more that I want to do, but it's almost ready for V1/demo tomorrow.
- Today, I came into the hub and hosted the fourth and final Critical AI Discussion Group meeting. I have really enjoyed this series of talks, and it's given me a lot to think about and expanded my perspective.
- After that, I attended the Val.town lunch & learn. I thought I already knew what Val.town was, but the talk was interesting because they discussed how it started and new things they are working on for the future. I had considered using Val to host the back end of my tarot app, and though I'm happy with the Python API I built, I will probably try it out some time in the future.
- Since my batch is ending soon (only 2 days left, wow), I am starting to reboot into job search mode. I am meeting with Laura from recruiting later, and I took some time to revise my resume this afternoon.
- The rest of this day I'll probably do some more work on the tarot app, plus a little more work on job search prep stuff.
