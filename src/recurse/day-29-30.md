title: Final Days of Batch
date: '2025-03-28'

- My batch officially ended today and it is bittersweet! However, I look forward to staying involved with RC as an alum.
- I added the final touches to my {% extLink "tarot app" "https://subtle.cards" %} and presented it on Thursday, right before our end-of-batch ceremonies. Between my work on that and on {% extLink "the Lab" "https://lab.palomakop.tv" %}, I feel like I accomplished my goals of building and learning and exploring during my six weeks at RC.
- During the celebration/pizza party, I had some fun conversations with folks, then pulled an Irish Goodbye as I was driving back home that night.
- Today, I mostly just rested and handled the logistical things that come with my transition out of batch-mode. I filled out the exit survey, made a new desk in the alum section of Virtual RC, and started preparing for my next steps (I'm playing a show this weeekend, and traveling to visit / help out my family next week).
- Got in my feels about the wonderful people I met in batch and while I'm sure it won't be the last I see of them, I will miss the concentrated collaborative times of being in batch together.
