- Came into the hub just in time to join the Monday Meditation session. We did a practice based on noticing mental images and the "screen of the mind." I enjoyed it and it was a nice way to start my day and week.
- I'm a little tired today because I played a show last night with some friends in Brooklyn. It went well and some people from RC came by to watch. I did get to bed at a pretty reasonable hour, but playing a show is always a little tiring, which is part of the reason I don't do it as often any more.
- Talked to some folks over lunch about magic eye, my irritation with React, and various historical types of brain surgery.
- Worked on my tarot app: added labels for each card, and an info section at the bottom of the pull page that shows information about the cards that were pulled. Also, the element of each card is displayed in a relevant color. I also made the design more responsive at small screen widths
