- Started a new front-end app template using the {% extLink "netlify template for react-router" "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/netlify" %}, and started messing around with it. So far it's a lot of new stuff: React, React-router, Typescript, and Tailwind all in one project. I'm able to make changes and see what they do, so hopefully I can figure it out enough by just searching for how to do individual things, because I'm not in the mood to build a tutorial project. I'd rather just build my own project (if a bit slowly) to learn instead.
- Joined the Job Search Support Group and Resum√© AMA calls. In the former, people talked about Leetcode a lot; I haven't done any of the exercises yet, but it's annoying that so many companies rely on those types of problems to screen applicants when they don't always correlate to actual practical programming knowledge. Still, *in this market* (as someone in the call said), they may be difficult to avoid. In the latter, Laura from the recruiting arm of RC gave some helpful tips and answered questions.
- Also had a 1:1 meeting with Laura, the ever-helpful job fairy of RC.

#### To-do:
- Style links & add a hover
- Add left and right padding to the about page content
- Fix excessive top and bottom padding on homepage

- Build the form for /pull/new
- Make form submission on /pull/new make api call and route to /pull/{id} page
- Build the /pull/{id} page with the data from payload response
- Figure out how tf react works more

#### Fun/ideas:
- Add page transitions
- Add a fun background to the splash page
- Make a loading animation for when the pull is submitted that looks like floating/shuffling cards
- Animate the cards flipping over one at a time when pull page is loaded
