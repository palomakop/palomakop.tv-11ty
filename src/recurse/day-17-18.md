- I didn't write a log update yesterday, and I wasn't able to spend the full day working on my tarot app project (due to external circumstances), but I did create the HTML portion of a tarot pull creation form at the `/pull/new` route on my GUI.
- Today, I came into the hub just in time for the Critical AI Discussion Group meeting, which I very lightly facilitated, and during which ranted a bit about gay space communism.
- Prepared materials for my workshop tomorrow.
- Started working on handling for the tarot pull form submission. Not much to show for it yet, but at least I understand typescript types slightly better.
- Gotta go catch an Amtrak train to Philly now, but I might keep working on my laptop on the train if I feel like it.
