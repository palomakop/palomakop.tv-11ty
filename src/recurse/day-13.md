- Joined the Critical AI Discussion Group call and had a very interesting chat with everyone who came. We all had very mixed feelings on the topic and it seemed very helpful to have a space to just share our thoughts, concerns, and experiences.
- Got an api key for the {% extLink "Random.org API" "https://api.random.org/json-rpc/4/basic" %} and started integrating it into my function that chooses the cards for the tarot spread.
- Continued working on the back end of the tarot app, and I now have almost the whole API working !!!

#### To-do:
- Make the database responses not have a bunch of escape characters in them
