**Tools used:**
- The static website is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), similarly to my main personal website
- Embedded interactive sketches created with:
  - [GLSL (fragment shaders)](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment_Shader)
  - [p5.js](https://p5js.org)
  - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- The Three.js sketch features a 3D model created in [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/)

**Highlights:**
- A dark/light mode that initializes based on the device preference, and saves the toggled state for future visits
- Text-adventure inspired minimalist interface for project navigation
- Interactive WebGL experiments and creative coding sketches
