This past Saturday, Andrei and I performed as [REALITY ORP](/art/reality-orp) on an outdoor stage at the {% extLink "ChaNorth" "https://www.chanorth.com/" %} Residency Space in Upstate NY. As part of Upstate Arts Week, ChaNorth held an edition of {% extLink "Weird Music Night" "https://www.instagram.com/weirdmusicnight" %}, a usually-New-Haven-based showcase, organized and hosted by {% extLink "John O'Donnell" "https://www.johnodonnellprojects.com/" %}. At this edition, there were eight total acts running throughout the evening, including Hudson-based artist duo {% extLink "Spyrodon" "https://spyrodon.bandcamp.com/" %}. On the same site, there were also open studios for the current artists in residence at ChaNorth, and a sculpture exhibition in the surrounding woods curated by {% extLink "Paradice Palace" "https://www.paradicepalase.com/" %} featuring a cool {% extLink "sculpture" "https://www.instagram.com/p/DMNXcfuu4YD/?img_index=1" %} by our friend Jonathan Sims.

We had a great time performing and hanging out with friends in the field as the sun went down. It was the sweet kind of summer show where people are sitting on blankets and there are random dogs running around among the audience. We were requested to park our van in the grass right next to the stage for Aesthetic Reasons.

Below is a short edit of some highlights from our set (or check out the full-length video recording on {% extLink "Youtube" "https://youtu.be/njjWkn3bpfI" %} or {% extLink "Peertube" "https://videos.scanlines.xyz/w/fwC5QCzoRHPrBpUsVfVCep" %}!)

We played after dark, and with the lack of outdoor lighting most of our photos were unsalvageable, but we did get this pic of John as a ghost in front of our van:
