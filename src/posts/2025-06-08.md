This past Friday, Andrei and I drove down to Greenpoint to perform an audiovisual set as REALITY ORP at a DIY venue called *Light and Sound Design*. The show was organized by {% extLink "Ka Baird" "https://www.kabaird.com/" %}, and featured fellow audiovisual artist duo {% extLink "MSHR" "https://mshr.info" %}.

The show went extremely well, and lots of friends came. The people who ran the venue were super nice, and the space was very well set up, with lots of comfortable seating and even a few foam pads and cushions in the very front for people to watch the show while lying down. {% extLink "Our friend Alec" "https://insomniachotel.bandcamp.com/" %} was running the quadrophonic sound setup.

After we performed, with Andrei on music (electronics, synths, percussion, and processed vocals) and me on video (modular synth, feedback, oscillators, cameras, etc.), I lay down in the front row to experience MSHR's set. They are currently touring with two sets: a hardware-based music set, which we saw them perform in New Haven last week, and an audiovisual set, which they performed at this show, so we got to see both. Their performance was really great â€” though I don't have much documentation to share here, you can view a past version of the same set on their Peertube: {% extLink "MSHR - Network Entity" "https://makertube.net/w/cnvHhDTKUkopoFVYFBjUnv" %}

Thanks to {% extLink "Jonathan" "https://chromadetic.com/" %}'s camerawork, we have a full recording of our set. Watch it below:
