On October 3, [REALITY ORP](/art/reality-orp) performed live over video chat for the {% extLink "Internet Archive" "https://archive.org/" %}'s ongoing series, titled: *Essential Music: Concerts from Home*. This series began during the pandemic in 2020, and the idea was to kick off each virtual staff meeting with a short live performance by a different artist. Due to extreme popularity among the staff, the series has continued through to today.

You can check out a recording of our set below, and eventually it will also be on the {% extLink "Internet Archive's collection of past installments of the series" "https://archive.org/details/essential-music-concerts-from-home" %}. And they are also looking for more artists to join, so if you'd be interested in doing a short set for them over Zoom, consider responding to their {% extLink "open call" "https://blog.archive.org/2025/08/20/calling-all-musicians-mini-concerts-at-the-internet-archive/" %}!

I am a big fan of the Internet Archive. I did a small volunteer project for them a while ago and know some of the people who work there, and have visited both their main office, and one of their warehouses, which was pretty wild to see. (We even randomly accidentally attended their in-person staff luncheon two years ago...)

They are a non-profit and have done some great work, including making it possible to {% extLink "play old video games in the browser" "https://archive.org/details/emulation" %}. It was a pleasure to get to perform for some very nice people. Many thanks to {% extLink "Kevin" "https://rulethepla.net/" %} for the invitation!
