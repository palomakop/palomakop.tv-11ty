This past Tuesday, {% extLink "Andrei", "https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/" %} and I made what is becoming a yearly pilgrimmage to Hamilton College in upstate New York, to give a workshop in analog video for our friend {% extLink "Anna Oxygen", "https://www.annaoxygen.com/" %}'s class, *TV Club*. Anna is a wonderful, wacky performance artist and teaches realtime digital art with weekly livestreams created and performed by the students. For their final week of class, we brought in a variety of analog video synths and effects and demonstrated them live on stream, then handed them over to the students and embraced the chaos that ensued.

Our trip home the next day was delayed by a blizzard that swept across the region, forcing us to take refuge at Crazy Otto's Diner in Herkimer, NY. Thankfully, we eventually made it home unscathed later that day.

Find some stills from our live analog video explorations with the students below.
