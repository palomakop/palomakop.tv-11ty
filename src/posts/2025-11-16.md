Since I launched my [Zine Club](/zine-club) project in spring of 2024, I've mailed out a total of over 200 Mystery Object packages to people in 8 countries. It's been a fun (and sometimes challenging) project that helps keep me creating weird art and brainstorming new ideas regularly.

The whole point of the Mystery Objects is that no one who subscribes to them knows what the next one will be until they open their bimonthly package. Last November, after sending out the first few Objects of the project, I made a [reveal post](/blog/2024-11-23_first-few-mystery-objects-revealed/) where I shared everything that had been sent so far. Well, it's been almost a year since then, so I am sharing another batch of Objects that I've made since then... Here is the reveal!

*Support Weird Art* is the official slogan of Zine Club. So of course I had to make something to let people spread the word. These holographic stickers seemed pretty effective, and they have the bonus of being kind of weird themselves.

{% endphotoGrid %}

*Interdependence* is a card from my [tarot of subtle forms](/art/tarot-of-subtle-forms/) deck. For this Object, I laser-cut and engraved the design into wood. This was my first time using the laser cutter at my local makerspace, and I was quite happy with the results.

{% endphotoGrid %}

I love silkscreen because it allows for printing with light ink on a dark background (a difficult task for most other print methods). However, before moving to New Haven and joining the makerspace, it had been a long time since I'd had access to screen printing equipment. This is the first print I made after gaining access to the print shop there, and I am super excited to do more with it soon. The design of this print is a still from some footage I recorded of ferrofluids, and it's titled *Magnetic Maze*.

{% endphotoGrid %}

This is a fridge magnet! The abstract design is based on a very weird analog video feedback recording called *Morphogenesis I*, which is part of my [Experiments in Public](/art/experiments-in-public/) series. I'll embed it below so you can see the origins:

{% photoGridItem "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/zine-club/gallery/nymph_eye.jpg", "Photo taken through the empty eye of the drawing, to reveal a rainbow-like image seen through the eye", false, false %}
{% endphotoGrid %}

Lastly, I made this small print on textured gray cardstock, with an insert of diffraction grating in the cutout of the eye. That is the kind of thin plastic film that splits apart wavelengths of light and makes everything look like rainbows! (Miniature Venus de Milo statue not included.)

To current members of Zine Club, I appreciate your support and participation and, occasionally, patience. Thanks to you, Zine Club has existed for 20 months and continues to be a source of fun and mystery to both the members and the maker!

If getting strange, mysterious packages at regular intervals sounds up your alley, check out the zine club webpage for more info: [palomakop.tv/zine-club](/zine-club). I'm currently working very hard to bring you the next mystery object in a few weeks, so it's a good time to get on board!

And even if you don't sign up right now, you can find out what the next batch of mystery objects were in... \*checks watch\* a year! Assuming that the pattern of these reveals continues. Thanks for reading, and remember, however you choose to do so... be sure to *SUPPORT WEIRD ART!*
