Last Thursday, Andrei and I performed again as [REALITY ORP](/art/reality-orp) at another {% extLink "Weird Music Night" "https://www.instagram.com/weirdmusicnight" %} event. This one was New Haven, which is where we live and also where that event series normally takes place. {% extLink "Ely Center" "https://elycenter.org/" %} is moving locations soon, so this will be the last Weird Music Night in their current space, an ornate, crumbling mansion with carved banisters. I am glad that we got to play in that space before they moved. Because there are so many rooms, everyone usually gets to set up in their own area and then the audience just moves from one room to the next when another act begins. Compared to hasty set changes in cramped spaces in Brooklyn where everyone has to move their tables around or break down gear right after playing, it is quite luxurious, and makes for a fun experience as each new space becomes activated.

Our friend {% extLink "Kit Young" "https://videoactiveavocado.com/" %} also performed as New Haven Noise Machine, a collaborative project with his friend Tryx. They live-scored a bunch of video portraits that Kit shot at the {% extLink "Video Sync" "https://videosync.xyz/" %} event last month in Portland, OR (which Andrei helped organize!)

Some local friends came out, as well as a couple who came from neighboring towns in Connecticut. I was given a CBD seltzer and a slice of very diversely topped pizza. Many thanks to {% extLink "John O'Donnell" "https://www.johnodonnellprojects.com/" %} for hosting and organizing again, and to Merlin and the amazing crew of Ely Center elves for all their work and energy.

Below, you can find some artifacts, including a video recording of (most of) our set, and some images. I actually remembered to snap a few photos, possibly mostly because I wanted to show off my outfit in which I dressed as much as possible like my own visuals.
