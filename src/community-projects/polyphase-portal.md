**Tools used:**
- The main website is a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) instance, which I set up with Woocommerce and Stripe integration for ticket sales
- We run a [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) instance for video calls (an open-source Zoom alternative that's tailored to online teaching)
- We also run a [Matrix chat server](https://matrix.org/)
- SSO with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)

**Highlights:**
- Complete educational platform infrastructure with integrated payment processing, video conferencing, and chat
- Single sign-on system allows students to move seamlessly between different services
- Self-hosted solution provides full control over data and user experience
