*Edge of Light* was a light art exhibition curated by fellow artist {% extLink "Jonathan Sims", "https://chromadetic.com/" %} for HoloCenter. I performed this a/v set for the exhibition opening, using an 8 foot spherical weather balloon as my projection surface. The opening performances were curated by {% extLink "Testu Collective", "https://www.testucollective.com/" %}, and the documentation was shot by Shintaro Ueyama.
