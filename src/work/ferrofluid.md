These two pieces were created using ferrofluid, an oily magnetic liquid. In *Labyrinthine*, the ferrofluid was placed inside a Hele-Shaw cell and manipulated using a handheld magnet, while in *Morphogenetics Fields*, it was influenced by a series of handmade electromagnetic coils. Both were shot from above using a macro lens. I was interested in working with the ferrofluid because of the organic quality of its movement. Because of the nature of fluid dynamics, a relatively simple system and set of fluctuating forces can result in these complex, dynamic behaviors, and the ferrofluid appears to come to life as some sort of strange organism.
