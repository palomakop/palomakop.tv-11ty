My piece, *Magnetic Field Recordings,* is on display as part of this exciting exhibition at Resonant Gallery, on campus of Western Michigan University in Grand Rapids. The exhibition was curated by new media artists and Kinetic Imaging faculty members {% extLink "Micah Alhadeff", "https://www.micahalhadeff.com/" %} and {% extLink "Eric Souther", "https://www.ericsouther.com/" %}, and features a diverse selection of video artists and toolmakers, many of whom I know through the analog video community. I wish I could make it out to Michigan to see the show in person.

From the show description:

> This exhibition showcases a multi-generational approach to exploring analog video as a creative medium, tracing its origins from the late 1960s and early 1970s to present. Artist approaching this then-new technology quickly discovered the limits of its possibilities and issues of access outside commercial television studios. This led to the development of artist-built tools that laid the groundwork for today's open-source ethos, a radical hacking of the black box that opened new ways of seeing and sparked a continual fascination with dismantling and reimagining technological systems, using error itself as a creative medium.
>
>While analog has been widely replaced by digital technologies, a dedicated community of working artists continues to choose this medium, cultivating an almost cult-like following. The language of analog continues to evolve as artists intertwine new processes, 3D animation and creative coding, into their workflows, challenging notions of technological obsolescence. Their work demonstrates that new ground can still be found in something "old," creating new hybrid forms by mixing contemporary technologies with analog processes.
