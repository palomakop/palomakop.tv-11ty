Our friend {% extLink "Kit Young", "https://videoactiveavocado.com" %} invited me and {% extLink "Andrei", "https://andreijaycreativecoding.com" %} to show our work in this group exhibition at the new Ely Center location. The exhibition will be on view until April 12.

The Ely Center is a wonderful community art space in New Haven. Before they moved, we performed live multiple times at their old location in a historic mansion. Now, following a move, they are re-opening their doors with this new show in which members of the board, many of whom are artists themselves, each invited 1 artist to participate.
