Our friend {% extLink "Kit Young", "https://videoactiveavocado.com" %} invited me and {% extLink "Andrei", "https://andreijaycreativecoding.com" %} to show our work in this group exhibition at the new Ely Center location, which opened on February 8th alongside solo exhibitions by the three Keyhole Artist in Residence.

The Ely Center is a wonderful community art space in New Haven. Before they moved, we performed live multiple times at their old location in a historic mansion. Now, following a move, they have re-opened their doors with this new show in which members of the curatorial committee, many of whom are artists themselves, each invited 1 artist to participate.

We showed the video piece from our project, [Synthetic Forest](/art/synthetic-forest), that we created in 2023 while in residency at Coaxial Arts in LA. We installed it on a CRT television monitor, with some chalk drawings on the floor.
