I helped organize this show featuring touring friends from Worcester, MA, {% extLink "Imaginary Prisons", "https://proto.garden/imaginary_prisons/" %} (experimental synths + soundscapes) and {% extLink "RUBY", "https://ru6y.com/" %} (livecoded electronica). Local support from {% extLink "The Herbalists", "https://theherbalists.bandcamp.com/" %} (dungeon synth) and {% extLink "Parlay Droner", "https://parlaydroner.bandcamp.com/" %} (warm tape textures).

I'll be performing live video projections throughout the evening as well 👁️✦👁️

The show will be at the new location of Ely Center, a community art space in New Haven and home of the iconic *Weird Music Night* series. Be sure to note their new location at 162 James Street, as they have recently moved!
