Magnetic Field Recordings is a series of images and sounds collected over the course of several years, using cameras, a radio scanner, oscillators, and an oscilloscope. The result is a hybrid space combining the environment's imagery and solar radiation with electronically produced signals and transmissions. We scan through various morphing geometric forms and drifting radio signals, exploring the harmonics and textures of this hybrid space. Locations of the recordings include Brooklyn, upstate New York, Chicago, and Central Asia.
