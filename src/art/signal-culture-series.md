The footage used in these works was recorded during my residency at {% extLink "Signal Culture", "https://signalculture.org/" %} in Owego, NY during the fall of 2017. Their facilities are home to many historic experimental video devices, which allow the use of electronic signals to manipulate analog video feeds and displays in realtime. For these pieces, I used the Jones Raster Scan (built by Dave Jones) and a modified CRT television known as the Wobbulator. The audio scores for these pieces were created in my own studio, using a variable-speed cassette player, field recordings, and synthesizers.
