*Chère Chambre* is a video piece that uses scan processing to reshape the rectangular grid of an analog video signal into a morphing wireframe form which appears to have dimension and depth.

I recorded the video track for this piece at {% extLink "Signal Culture", "https://signalculture.org/" %} using the Jones Raster Scan, which was designed and built by Dave Jones. Since the Raster Scan outputs voltage to control an XYZ oscilloscope, I rescanned the oscilloscope screen in the studio with a DSLR in order to digitize the signal.

The audio was recorded on the Doepfer system at Alfred University, using a system of photoresistors to translate the light from the video channel to control signals to affect the sound.
