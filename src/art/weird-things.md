*Weird Things* was shot and recorded in Owego, NY during my residency at {% extLink "Signal Culture", "https://signalculture.org/" %}. Owego is a small, quirky town in Western NY; sometimes going there can feel like traveling to a different point in time, perhaps evoking the work of David Lynch. The various signage around town, which appears in the source material for this piece, definitely plays a role in creating that impression.

I processed the footage using Signal Culture's analog video equipment, including a camera feedback loop, and the Jones Colorizer, which was created by Dave Jones. The soundtrack was created using a Korg synthesizer.
