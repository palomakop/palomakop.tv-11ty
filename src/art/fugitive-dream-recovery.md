*Fugitive Dream Recovery* was a collaborative A/V project I started with {% extLink "Bobby Pharaoh" "https://www.instagram.com/bobby.pharaoh/" %} in a basement in Ridgewood, Queens. We spent a lot of time experimenting together, and produced a number of audiovisual pieces under this name, as well as several performances. Our most frequently used tools included oscilloscopes, the Panasonic MX-50 video mixer, and a Make Noise modular synthesizer. We also modified several video devices to allow us to control them with voltage from the modular synth. In our audiovisual collaborations, we both controlled aspects of sound and video simultaneously (rather than having one person on sound and another on video), with a focus on synesthesic relationships between the sound and visuals.

In 2019, we released a 60 minute VHS tape of our experiments on {% extLink "Bleu Nuit Video" "https://bleunuitvideo.bandcamp.com/music" %}. The tape is sold out, but you can watch the {% extLink "trailer" "https://youtu.be/sG2EjAnrt7M" %}. The project has been inactive since that time.
