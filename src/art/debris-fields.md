## Matthew Ryals â€” *debris fields (take 2)*, {{workYear}}

{% video "1038283597", "https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1038283597/rendition/720p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=32d1fc2192b6ca263610072787b314f8de93ef1026100aa7514adb7d5037a590", '{"Youtube":"https://youtu.be/QJ8XqnRcD8o","Peertube":"https://videos.scanlines.xyz/w/hR9SndL529y4iKWu8AMH7x"}' %}

A music video for *debris fields (take 2)* by {% extLink "Matthew Ryals", "https://www.matthewryals.com" %}, from his album {% extLink "impromtus in isolation", "https://matthewryals.bandcamp.com/album/impromptus-in-isolation" %}, a series of improvisational recordings created during Covid-19 lockdown.

I had the opportunity to create the music video for this track, using video footage from Matthew's recording session. I took that footage and ran it through a series of analog and digital processes, then re-combined the resulting output with the original source footage. The layers of analog processing and feedback interact with Matthew's movements and the blinking lights of his modular synth in interesting ways. Representation slowly gives way to abstraction, then eventually returns, following the arc of the musical piece.
