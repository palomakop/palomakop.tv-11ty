On two occasions, I have had the opportunity to perform live at {% extLink "Ambient Church", "https://www.ambient.church/" %}, a series of ambient music concerts held in churches with projection mapped visuals. My live visuals were mapped to the architecture, creating an immersive multimedia experience.

My first show with them was at a church in Bushwick, where I performed with musicians Malcolm Cecil (ex. TONTO's Exploding Head Band) and Steve Moore (of Zombi) in 2018. Then, in 2022, I returned to perform with Suzanne Ciani and Lori Scacco at a church in the upper west side.
