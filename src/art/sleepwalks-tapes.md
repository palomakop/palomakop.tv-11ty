*Sleepwalks* was a solo project I released ambient casette tapes and played shows under from 2017-2018. I began recording *Young & Ugly* in the summer of 2016, when I spent a week in the forests of Oregon with a generator and a 1000-watt sound system inside a room-sized inflatable cube. Most of the tracks on these tapes were recorded while traveling.
