*Recursive News* was a livestream performance for {% extLink "/'FU:BAR/ Festival" "https://fubar.space/" %} in 2020. I collaborated with Andrei Jay, Allen Riley, Rob Yohe, and Irfan BrkoviÄ‡ to create this piece in the basement studio of {% extLink "Phase Space" "https://phaseshift.zone/phase-space-archive/" %} in Brooklyn, NY during the Covid-19 shutdown. Our goal was to create an extremely psychedelic simulacrum of a cable access station news broadcast, using a series of analog video mixers plugged into each other and themselves in a labyrinthine nest of feedback loops and effects chains.

Andrei and I primarily controlled the video mixing and effects, while Rob and Allen played the news anchors, although I also appeared as a guest crystallography expert, and everyone did a little bit of everything. Find some behind-the-scenes photo documentation below.
