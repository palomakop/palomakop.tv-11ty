_The Life Cycle of Aritanian Flowers_ is a deck of 16 printed cards. I created an edition of 20 decks as one of the Mystery Objects for <a href="/zine-club">Zine Club</a>. The cards were digitally printed on both sides, then cut down by hand.

The idea behind this project was to create a set of flashcards to aid in studying the life cycle of a fictional species of plant that grows in the non-existent land of _Aritana Occ_, which is inhabited by fractal beings. Each illustration is based on a still frame of video feedback, recorded by pointing a camera at a television screen displaying its own output.

I currently don't plan to print another edition of these cards, so I am making a printable PDF file available for anyone who wishes to print their own deck for personal use:

<details><summary>Steps to create your own deck</summary>

1. Download the {% extLink "Printable PDF file" "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/works/life-cycle-of-artianian-flowers/life_cycle_cards_printable.pdf" %} (6.2 MB)

2. Get 4 sheets of cardstock in a light color of your choice

3. Print the PDF with the "double-sided" option switched ON. (Note: if your printer doesn't have this feature, print odd pages first, then turn them over and print even pages)

4. Cut out the cards using the crop marks as a guide

5. Optional: use a round corner punch on all four corners of each card
