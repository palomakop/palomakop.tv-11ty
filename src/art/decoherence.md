*Decoherence* is an audiovisual composition made with sound waves, water, and granular and spectral processing. A 60 cycle drone from a speaker cone below creates subtle patterns on the liquid surface, which grows increasingly turbulent. This piece explores interference patterns, the interplay of macro and microscopic patterns, chaos and continuua.

As a companion to this piece, I also created a short zine that would later become part of my [mfa thesis book](/mfa). Find some excerpts below, or read the whole thing as a {% extLink "pdf", "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/palomakop.tv/works/decoherence/decoherence_book.pdf" %} (9 MB).
