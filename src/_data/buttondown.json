This was for a few reasons; I have been adjusting to my new job, and I also haven’t had many “time-sensitive announcements” to make.</p><p>Well, now it is now, and I actually have several things to share all at the same time! I’m in two art exhibitions that open this weekend, one in New Haven, CT, and one at Western Michigan University.

(Under the hood, I made it easier to share event invites and upcoming events, and built myself some JavaScript-based GUI tools for editing my website code.)</p><p>I also started a project with a friend where we send each other music we make every 2 weeks. I haven’t shared any of the songs publicly yet, but it’s been a great thing for getting me to work with sound more.</p><p>I’ve continued my weekly work at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://faruqeedriscollstudio.com/\">Faruqee Driscoll Studio</a>. My most interesting tasks recently have included automating the creation of generative graphics, and doing CAD for custom laser-cut steel tools. It’s been extremely cold for the last month here in New Haven, and like many people in the northeast, we got about 18 inches of snow all at once last week. So… there’s that.</p><p>Thanks for being on this list, and staying connected with me despite my relative lack of normal social media. Hope you are all doing well. Keep in touch.</p><buttondown-snippet name=\"signature\"></buttondown-snippet>",

    "body": "<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Hello!</p><p>It’s been a minute since I last wrote a newsletter, so here are some updates!</p><p>In the last issue, I was still job searching, and I’m happy to report that in the meantime, I found and started a new role as a studio assistant for an artist couple who make cool <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://faruqeedriscollstudio.com/\">moiré pattern paintings</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/70b6ccfc-84f6-4e0e-ae72-483ee1ef65ee.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"detail of an overlapping pattern of blue, red, and yellow curved concentric stripes\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Detail of <em>2019P-24 (Circle)</em> by Anoka Faruqee &amp; David Driscoll</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/36e794d7-51f9-4f67-a46f-e0e90fc24dd1.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"abstract painting created with interference patterns between layers of stripes\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption><em>2014P-07</em> by Anoka Faruqee and David Driscoll</figcaption></figure><p>So far it’s been an interesting gig, and I’ve learned some new things in both physical and digital media to support their work. I am also doing some carpentry and helping build out/maintain their studio, which has inspired me to get back into doing more woodworking projects. (If you’ve been following this newsletter for a while, you may recall my shed project from last year!) I have wood shop access at work, but it’s ended up being more convenient to use the wood shop at MakeHaven, the local makerspace, since they sell sheets of high quality plywood there and have a wider array of saws.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/26ceadf5-37df-4ff1-889d-9821e5188969.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"close up of a wooden table\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Detail of a new, matte-finished countertop in my kitchen</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/adfe0d63-ba92-475b-9537-cd9c426bbac2.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"two wooden wedge-shaped speaker sands on top of a table\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>A pair of angled speaker stands made of plywood</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve also been doing some 3D modeling and CAD in Rhino at my new job, which led to me trying it out for designing objects I’m making outside work as well. So far, I have enjoyed using Rhino a lot more than other 3D modeling programs I’ve tried, and it has some powerful scripting/automation capabilities that I would like to try using for “art” in addition to these more practical objects.</p><p>Also, the people I work for recently got a puppy, so my job has expanded slightly to include helping care for him. His name is Thor, and he is currently four months old and learning about the world.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/31b7c83e-0e1e-4526-864b-4c2fadeff84e.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"a dog standing on a rock in a stream\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Thor the puppy exploring in the woods</figcaption></figure><p>In more tech-related updates, I had been meaning to get back into journaling more regularly, so I ended up building a simple web app in Python/Flask, and started hosting it on a Raspberry Pi (a small linux computer) located in a corner of my office/studio. It’s cool to host my own little website and know that every time I use it, I’m connecting directly to a physical device in my home. Even though it’s mostly just for my own use (the UI is ideal for casually writing on my phone), anyone can view my public posts at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://journal.palomakop.tv/\">https://journal.palomakop.tv/</a>. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/palomakop/journal\">code</a> is also public so theoretically other people can use it to run their own journals as well, if they share my niche desire for a web-based journaling system.</p><p>I am continually having new ideas for website improvements and other custom things that I want to build for myself and my friends. Since coding is not the primary focus of my current job (though I have snuck in some Adobe and Rhino automations to streamline processes there), and I’m usually not already sitting at the computer for most of my day, I think that gives me more mental bandwidth to work on computer-based personal projects during my time off.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/385b939b-f2b2-442a-b6bf-1a2c8ddcc706.png\" alt=\"reality orp\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Since my last newsletter went out, Andrei and I have performed two live audiovisual sets as REALITY ORP, one at Light &amp; Sound Design in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and one just this past Saturday at ChaNorth Residency Space in Pine Plains, NY. I shared a bit more about both shows <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/blog/\">on my blog</a>, and below is a short edit of some of the sounds and visuals from our most recent show:</p><figure><a href=\"https://youtu.be/B5YDG9AWhWs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/842735d1-3a5b-4a59-acd5-e89002b48b46.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"video still from show highlights reel\" draggable=\"false\"></a><figcaption>3:30 | Watch on: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5YDG9AWhWs\">Youtube</a> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://videos.scanlines.xyz/w/mQSz95evenDr579F1TXp1t\">Peertube</a></figcaption></figure><p>Both shows were really fun and nice opportunities for friends to gather around for strange rituals. I usually try to share more info about events I’m doing <em>before</em> they happen, but I dropped the ball on that for the most recent one. Hopefully I will do better going forward! To that end, our next show will be <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/weirdmusicnight\">Weird Music Night</a> on September 11, at the Ely Art Center in New Haven, CT, 7pm. Our friend <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://videoactiveavocado.com/\">Kit</a> is also playing so it should be a great time! Too early for a flyer to exist, but mark your calendar if you’re one of the approximately 2 people on this list who live in the New Haven area :) It will also be the last Weird Music Night until Ely Center is settled from their upcoming location transition.</p><p>Well, that’s probably enough “news” for this edition of the newsletter. Be well, and stay in touch.</p><buttondown-snippet name=\"signature\"></buttondown-snippet>",

Here in New Haven, CT, it’s been raining a lot lately; the upside is that all of the plants are thriving. Whenever it’s not raining, I’ve been spending as much time as I can outside.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/0453b578-ced8-4ee5-9d54-b7f692b4e654.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"A beach on a cloudy day, in the distance the sun is shining down through some gaps\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>A beach I visited recently</figcaption></figure><p>If I’m being totally honest, while the weather is helping me feel optimistic lately, there has also been a lot of other stuff that is doing the opposite. I have had to make a strong effort to avoid spending more than a few minutes on social media and news feeds per day, or else risk catching a debilitating case of gloom. But even avoiding these things doesn’t make the job market any better or the cost of basic needs any lower, and it’s hard to imagine that any of the terrible things going on right now will stop any time soon. Normally I reserve this topic for in-person conversation, but at this point it feels strange not to mention it at all. Thankfully, I also have some exciting and fun things going on as well, so I will share a few of them here. Hopefully they will brighten your day a little too, and help offset the other stuff just a tiny bit.</p><p>After my last update in March, I had a very busy spell where I played two shows, taught a workshop, and finished off my six-week batch at Recurse Center — along with the coding projects I was working on during that time. Afterwards, I managed to gather a bit of documentation about each of these things on my blog.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f8915a60-5b83-4462-b4a8-0a3aee7f6a4c.jpeg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"People in a classroom learning about HTML\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>HTML workshop at Low Tech Electronics Faire; photo by Calvin Leon.

(Check it out <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://subtle.cards/\">here</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>I had a very fun and productive time during my retreat at RC, and have kept in touch with some folks from the community there. But it was also a bit intense! So after finishing all of these things, I tried to take a bit of a break.</p><p>In April, I resumed working on freelance projects, mainly building websites and running AV tech for events. (I still have some availability for freelance website and coding work — if you need anything, get in touch!) I am still hoping to find more long-term employment soon, and have been throwing all of my spare energy towards that, but I haven’t had much luck yet. So I’ll just keep stitching various things together for now. (It is really not a great time(/economy) to be job searching in; solidarity to anyone else who’s in that boat right now.)</p><p>I also took some time to expand and improve my own website. I added a sidebar for desktop and a hamburger menu for mobile, which enabled me to add more pages to the main navigation. I also renamed my “work” section to “art” and created a new section called “code” to house <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/code/\">a portfolio of my coding and web projects</a>.</p><p>If you haven’t seen my website in a while, I invite you to give it a visit and poke around a little!</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/\">https://palomakop.tv</a></p><p>Lastly, another thing I’ve been excited about lately is that I gained access to the silkscreen facilities at MakeHaven, my local makerspace. I don’t want to share photos yet, in case anyone is on here that hasn’t received theirs yet, but I did my first print run and sent them out to members of the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/zine-club/\">Zine Club</a> Mystery Object tier. I look forward to doing some more silkscreen printing and maybe making some patches or T shirts!</p><p>All right, that’s probably enough for now.

    "body": "<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Hello again friends,</p><p>There are an unexpectedly large number of things going on right now for me. Since my last update, I’ve finished settling into our new apartment in New Haven, and my new studio/office is very nice.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bd0022d9-8c98-4fe0-8c9a-46dc263d0a9d.png?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"isometric drawing of my new workspace, with a desk, shelves, and a corner with a beanbag chair\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>A little isometric drawing of my new workspace. I shared more about my new setup on my <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/blog/2025-01-22_new-studio-tour/\">blog</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>So… I left my full-time job in 2023 to travel and be self-employed, and now, almost two years later, it turns out that I feel ready to return to a more “normal” job again. I started polishing up my resumé and created an account on LinkedIn (something I have resisted doing for a long time).</p><p>Well, it turns out that my resistance was justified, because LinkedIn is, in fact, an extremely hellish platform. Within a couple days of joining, I managed to get my new account banned <em>twice</em> until I figured out that some software I run for online privacy was making them think I was a bot. (That has since been resolved, but it didn’t exactly inspire confidence.)</p><p>It’s been a while since I undertook this type of job search, so if anyone has any recommendations or advice, or if you know someone who is hiring, please get in touch. I’m especially looking for jobs in software development/IT, and I’m in New Haven but can make it to NYC fairly easily. I published a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/resume/\">resumé page</a> on my website, feel free to share it if you want to.</p><p>Also, if you use LinkedIn as well, please feel free to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/palomakop/\">connect with me there</a> and we can “endorse” each others’ “skills.” At least until I get banned again!</p><p>In semi-related news, I am excited to be attending a 6-week coding retreat at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.recurse.com/\">Recurse Center</a>. I’ve heard a lot about their program from friends that have attended, so I’m looking forward to finally getting to participate myself. It’s sort of like an artist residency, but for computer programming instead of art. (Although you can also make art if your art consists of coding computer programs.) You can work on whatever projects you decide, and collaborate with others who are doing the same. The goals are to improve your coding skills and challenge yourself to try new things, while also building community, and they can also help connect you with job openings.</p><p>Since I’ve been obsessively building websites for the past couple of years, I’m planning to channel that energy into making some interactive web-based experiments and pushing myself beyond my current comfort zone of fully static HTML/CSS. The session I’m attending starts in just over a week! I’ll be heading into their Brooklyn-based hub for some of it, and doing the rest remotely.</p><p>What else is going on? I’m teaching an HTML/CSS weekend intensive workshop at Wavefield in Brooklyn on March 8-9. If you’re in the area and want to learn how to build websites from scratch, or you already know how to and just need some external motivation to get you to actually do it, consider joining! If it’s anything like the online version of this class I did last year, it should be really fun. I can’t wait to see what people make.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://withfriends.co/event/22719582/weekend_website_workshop_htmlcss_2_day_intensive_with_paloma_kop#\">Tickets via Wavefield on Withfriends</a></p><figure><a href=\"https://withfriends.co/event/22719582/weekend_website_workshop_htmlcss_2_day_intensive_with_paloma_kop#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/087d01f8-514a-4d84-94f7-f2152333f3c2.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"Weekend Website Workshop\" draggable=\"false\"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from those things, I joined an awesome <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.makehaven.org/\">Makerspace in New Haven</a> and am looking forward to using some of their extensive array of tools to make my next batch of Mystery Objects for <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/zine-club/\">Zine Club</a>. I also started doing a work-trade at a local yoga studio. There are a lot of cool things in New Haven!</p><p>I have more things coming up in March that I’m excited to share, but they are still in the cocoon stage of being organized, so I’ll probably send out another update early next month.

    "body": "<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Hello Friends,</p><p>It’s been a few months. I’m writing from a new apartment in New Haven, CT. As of a few days ago, Andrei and I have moved out of our temporary yurt residence and into what we hope will be a more long-term situation. The biggest highlight for me is once again having my own private room to dedicate to studio and workspace. This is something I haven’t really had since I left Brooklyn in spring 2023, and I’ve missed it dearly, so I now appreciate it a <em>lot</em> more. While the prospect of paying something closer to a normal<sup>*</sup> amount for rent is slightly daunting, I have decided that the tradeoff of not having to constantly uproot myself is worth it.</p><p><sup>* </sup><em><sup>”Normal” for the US in this era of ridiculously inflated living costs.</sup></em></p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bca14a81-6e88-4e96-9b45-8196733b2d89.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"A room with sand-colored walls, a futon, a small dining table, and a lot of bright windows\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Our new apartment in New Haven.

Bye, yurt!</figcaption></figure><p>In other news, I finished up my semester teaching two sections of <em>Intro to Animation</em> as a temporary adjunct at Hamilton College. I really enjoyed the experience of teaching, and I hope to find more opportunities to do so in the future.</p><p>In the meantime, since I’m no longer occupied with teaching classes, I’m very much <strong>available and eager for more freelance projects and commissions!</strong> If you or anyone you know needs a website, video/graphics, or other types of things that are up my alley, please let me know!</p><p>Other things I’ve been working on include extensive updates to my website. I’ve added a bunch of past work to the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/work/\">/work page on my site</a>, and I also fleshed out my long-neglected <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/mfa/\">MFA page</a> with photos of my thesis book and an index of my thesis work. And there are still more website updates I want to do. I have decided to add a new section for client work and commissions to my main website, instead of having a separate website for my “business” portfolio (which I’ve not-coincidentally been procrastinating working on). After all, the line can be blurry; there are already some things I got paid to do on the /work page mentioned above, and I strive to make work I’m creatively proud of whether it’s for a client or myself.</p><p>I’ve also continued making physical and digital objects for <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/zine-club/\">Zine Club</a>. It’s been a fun challenge to come up with new and unusual things to send out for each edition; the most recent favorite of these was a “useless” printed circuit board design. I also updated the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/zine-club/\">webpage</a> with photos of past objects (all sent long enough ago to avoid spoiling them), and added a few <em>testimonials</em>, courtesy of some club members!</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/0815c8c6-a23b-404a-88af-95e0e1c35ef6.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"A hand holding a PCB board with an abstract design in white silkscreen and gold\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Useless PCB for Zine Club.

    "body": "<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Hello Friends,</p><p>This feels like a weird time to be breaking my hiatus from sending newsletter updates. I and many of my friends in the US are still mentally processing the events of the election and how they will continue to play out in the coming years. But of course, we need to continue with the work that we have cut out for us, and supporting the pockets of creativity, community, and empowerment that will continue to keep us going through whatever else is going on in the world.</p><p>It’s been even longer than usual between updates from me for a few reasons. Firstly, I was working hard on rebuilding my artist website using a tool called <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a>. My site is still coded from scratch, but using this tool allows me to update and edit everything <em>much</em> more easily compared working directly with HTML files. While this was in progress, I didn’t make any new blog posts for a long time, since they would have just added to the things I had to migrate… But now, after a few months of chugging away on it in my spare time, I’m happy to say that the new version is now live! Some things are similar to the old site, but there are a lot of subtle improvements. I invite you to come visit my new site and poke around: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/\">https://palomakop.tv/</a></p><p>In particular, consider checking out the new version of the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/blog/\">blog</a> — I’ve just added some belated posts about shows and things that I did in late summer. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/blog/\">https://palomakop.tv/blog/</a></p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/37ebccc2-86b7-44b0-89af-5465469d834d.png?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"Screenshot of the website palomakop.tv\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Screenshot of the new version of my artist website</figcaption></figure><p>Another reason I have been a bit quieter than usual is that I was last-minute hired for the semester as an adjunct professor of animation at Hamilton College, which is a few hours north of me, near Utica. I have been driving back and forth each week and teaching two sections of Intro to Animation. This is my first time teaching at a college, and I have been enjoying it a lot. I often think about the professors I had in college who introduced me to so many interesting new things and expanded my world, and it makes me want to help pass that forward to my students.</p><p>Meanwhile, as of September, Andrei and I have taken up temporary residence in a yurt near Saugerties, NY. We will be here until the end of the year, when we plan to look for a more permanent space of some kind. After being quite mobile for a year and a half, we are ready to settle in somewhere and set up proper studio/work spaces. But in the meantime, yurt existence is quite cozy.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6039732d-dbf9-48e2-8299-83255602b14e.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"A forest with bare trees, a thick bed of leaves, rocky outcrops, and a blue sky. Off to the right, a van and yurt are visible\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Woods near the yurt, post leaf-fall</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve continued to send out bimonthly mystery objects and quarterly e-zines for <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/zine-club/\">Zine Club</a>, which has slowly been accruing new members; there are now 25. The latest mystery object that I can share (since it was sent out long enough ago that it’s no longer a mystery) was a handmade set of mysterious cards based on the life cycle of a fictional plant.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/73973745-3016-4ee5-92ad-ec816f1fc021.jpeg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"A hand holding a spread of cards with abstract spiral drawings on them and titles like Spore, Encapsulation, and Rhizomorph\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Photo by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://merveilles.town/@tendigits\">tendigits</a></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the newsletter, I usually write a bit about events and things I have coming up, but to be honest, I don’t have anything like that going on right now. I will quietly continue teaching my classes, making zines and objects, doing miscellaneous freelance projects, and figuring out how and where I want to live. I guess the only thing I ask is, let’s keep in touch. Let me know what you’re up to. Let’s keep making art and being there for each other.</p><p>Until next time, take good care however you can.</p><buttondown-snippet name=\"signature\"></buttondown-snippet>",

    "body": "<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Hello friends,</p><p>It’s been a few months since my last update, and the time has seemingly flown by. I’m still here in Upstate NY, doing my best to slowly carve out space to live and work on a small budget so I can spend more time on creative things and in nature. Currently, this has taken the form of sleeping in a small, semi off-grid cabin in the woods, and working on fixing up a small barn (which long ago was home to a pony) on my family’s property to transform it into an art studio.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/5a568c92-0410-40b2-8731-cccee30da9e2.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"Photo of the inside of a small cabin space with double screen doors facing a green forest landscape\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>The view from my cabin</figcaption></figure><p>Besides playing with power tools and hanging out in the forest, I’ve also been doing some art things. In May, Andrei and I performed a characteristically wacky set as <em>Reality Orp</em> at the Psychic Garden in Rochester. The stars magically aligned and we managed to record decent audio and video of the full set, so it’s now up on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/1cz4QXE4YLg?si=yazCSPPDBiX2k8GZ\">Youtube</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://videos.scanlines.xyz/w/7sVx4Gj7TZ8Kg2rC69cgHs\">Peertube</a>!</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/853e6f86-fea8-4628-b126-df1fbc15eeff.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"Video still of an audiovisual performance with multiple projections and a stack of CRT monitors, all displaying abstract video art\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption><em>Reality Orp</em> performance at the Psychic Garden</figcaption></figure><p>I also sent out the first Mystery Object &amp; Quarterly E-zine for my new <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://palomakop.tv/zine-club/\">Zine Club</a> project. (Some of you were on the receiving end!) There are now 18 total Zine Club members, which is pretty cool. I quite enjoyed creating both the physical object (3 vinyl stickers this time) and the virtual zine, which I provided as both a downloadable DRM-free PDF and an <em>online 3D skeuomorphic reading experience</em> (see GIF below). So far, the goal of Zine Club — which is to <em>support weird art</em> — seems to be working in two ways: it provides me with a small but regular supplementary income, and creates a framework of formats and loose deadlines that helps make me actually do things. I hope to keep this project going for a while!

I am also hoping to take some time to overhaul my own websites as well; the Moon Ark site needs a “design portfolio,” and I want to make my artist website easier to update. I can’t express how much better it feels to put my tech skills to use for actual people, instead of a corporation. (Not to mention much more fun.)</p><h1>🔜 Upcoming Things</h1><p>In July, Andrei and I will be taking another road trip in our 1988 camper van. But it will be <em>much</em> shorter and chiller than last year’s 5-month, 7000-mile adventure (which ended up being too much for me…) We’ll be traveling around the midwest, starting with an artist residency &amp; workshop in Iowa City, and some vague plans in other places including Champaign-Urbana, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. (If anyone reading this is in the Iowa City area, join our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.publicspaceone.com/events/analog-video-signals\">workshop on July 6</a>!)</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/88663642-2045-49c7-a7c8-a1f07afaed57.png?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"Illustration of a 1988 Chevy G20 van with gray and white horizontal stripes, and pink gradient windows\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>We’ll be back on the road in this van in July!</figcaption></figure><p>Well, that’s probably enough for now; more updates whenever I end up writing them.

Much has occurred since my last newsletter went out; I did an artist talk at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://luckdragon.space/\">Luck Dragon</a> in Delhi, NY, went on a 7-day silent retreat at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dharma.org/\">IMS</a>, acquired a canine hiking buddy, taught an online HTML/CSS class, and was generally quite busy. I guess I assumed that being tucked away in the woods would be more quiet and peaceful, but at the same time I'm quite happy that we've found lots of interesting things to do that don't involve going into a large city.</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2b353198-aed7-4a49-9a69-33aa1a8d2add.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"A dog wearing an orange bandana, sitting in front of a small pond.

    "body": "<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Hello friends!</p><p>With the new year comes some new updates on how this newsletter is run. My old method of BCC'ing everyone was getting too unwieldy, so I decided to bite the bullet and start using a \"professional\" email newsletter service (the one I chose is called Buttondown). I also have a new email address that's connected to the domain of my website: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"mailto:paloma@palomakop.tv\">paloma@palomakop.tv</a>. Hopefully everything should work the same from your end! If this email reached your inbox successfully, it would be really nice if you could drop a quick reply that you received it; then I'll know they didn't all go straight into spam or something :)</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c773d47f-d46c-4e0a-b012-28a2414e68e5.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"Esopus Creek in the snow\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Esopus Creek in the snow</figcaption></figure><p>I'm still in Upstate New York, and it's pretty cold and snowy here right now. I caught a case of covid shortly after New Year's, but luckily it was pretty mild. Other than that, I'm just enjoying having a proper workspace again, for both my computer work and audiovisual experiments!</p><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d5520030-cbc4-4ae6-a99c-759e1bd58e65.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"My modular system stretching its sleepy circuitry after over 6 months in storage\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>My modular system stretching its sleepy circuitry after over 6 months in storage</figcaption></figure><p>A lot has been brewing since my last update in November... Here are some things I have coming up:</p><hr><h2>Presentation at 'Sound'</h2><p>This Friday, I'll be one of two presenters at a monthly event called <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://luckdragon.space/event/sound.html\">Sound</a>, in Delhi, NY. The venue is Luck Dragon, a craft supply store and community space. Hopefully I will meet some new local artists and experimental musicians there!

They are each a series of 4 weekly sessions, intended for realtime virtual participation.</p><figure><a href=\"https://polyphaseportal.xyz/2023/11/20/making-fun-simple-websites-with-handwritten-html-css/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b9efe510-cc1a-46b6-bee1-e4bb8c4854bd.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max\" draggable=\"false\"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://polyphaseportal.xyz/2023/11/20/making-fun-simple-websites-with-handwritten-html-css/\"><strong>Making Fun, Simple Websites with Handwritten HTML/CSS</strong></a> - February 13-March 5</p><p>An introductory course on working directly with HTML and CSS code.

This is a page where I can share what I'm up to and some currently relevant links, updated weekly-ish.</p><p>I made some zines over the holidays to give out to friends, and it was very fun. I'm thinking of starting a subscription thing through Patreon where you can sign up to receive a new print or zine or sticker every month or every 2 months. If this is something you'd be interested in, let me know, that will help me decide to go ahead with it!</p><p>I'll be on a meditation retreat from February 2-9 in rural Massachusetts, and will be unreachable during that time. I'm looking forward to taking some quiet time/space. Other than that, between upcoming classes, freelance projects, art-making, and house-sitting duties, I seem to have my work cut out for me. I am wishing you a good 2024 and hope that you are staying cozy if it's cold where you are (or staying cool if it's hot)!</p><p>Until next time, be well.</p><buttondown-snippet name=\"signature\"></buttondown-snippet><figure><img src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3915175b-4e74-4bdc-a1ff-b7873fb1705b.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max\" alt=\"Icicles in the stream\" draggable=\"false\"><figcaption>Icicles in the stream</figcaption></figure>",
