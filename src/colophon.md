## About This Website

This website was built with {% extLink "11ty", "https://www.11ty.dev/" %} and is hosted on Netlify. I began working on this version of the site in 2024. The previous version, which I began in 2022, was built with plain HTML and CSS, with a tiny bit of optional Javascript. This version uses much of the same code, but thanks to 11ty and the power of *static site generation*, it's much easier to update and maintain.

Before the plain HTML version, I built and hosted my site on {% extLink "Cargo", "https://cargo.site/" %} starting in about 2015. I finally moved away from that platform to take full control and ownership over my presence on the web, and never looked back. It has taken a *lot* of effort to build my own site from scratch, but it has been a fun, rewarding, and educational process. I enjoyed it so much that I have since begun teaching HTML/CSS workshops to help others experience the same struggles and joy.

I got a lot of help, inspiration, and reference material from many folks along the way. Most especially, personal websites and wikis from others in {% extLink "merveilles", "https://merveilles.town/about" %}, {% extLink "xxiivv webring", "https://webring.xxiivv.com/" %}, and adjacent communities, and the ideas of permacomputing, digital gardens, and the *small web* which they have instilled in me. 

This site is an ongoing project as I continue to update and expand it. My goal is to make it as accessible and pleasant to explore as possible, regardless of visitors' hardware or software environments. Feel free to <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> with any feedback.
