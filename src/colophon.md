This website was built with {% extLink "11ty", "https://www.11ty.dev/" %} and is hosted on Netlify. I began working on this version of the site in June 2024. The previous version, which I began in 2022, was built with plain HTML and CSS, with a tiny bit of optional Javascript. This version uses much of the same code, but thanks to 11ty and the power of *static site generation*, it's much easier to update and maintain.

Before the plain HTML version, I built and hosted my site on {% extLink "Cargo", "https://cargo.site/" %} starting in about 2015. I finally moved away from that platform to take full control and ownership over my presence on the web, and never looked back. It has taken a *lot* of effort to build from scratch, but it has also been an extremely fun, rewarding, and educational process. I enjoyed it so much that I have since begun teaching HTML/CSS workshops to help others experience the same struggles and joy.

I got a lot of help, inspiration, and reference material from many folks along the way. Most especially, personal websites and wikis from others in {% extLink "merveilles", "https://merveilles.town/about" %}, {% extLink "xxiivv webring", "https://webring.xxiivv.com/" %}, and adjacent communities, and the ideas of permacomputing, digital gardens, and the *small web* which they have instilled in me. (Visit my [links page](/links) to find more of my friends and inspirations.)

This site is an ongoing project as I continue to update and expand it. My goal is to make it as accessible and pleasant to explore as possible, regardless of visitors' hardware or software environments. Feel free to [get in touch](/contact) with any feedback.
